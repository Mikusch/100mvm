# Unlimited MvM Bots

This is a simple plugin that allows spawning up to 90 bots in MvM. Comes with the convar `sm_mvm_remove_bot_cosmetics`, which you will most definitely need.

**You will need a mission specifically made with increased bot count in mind. Most missions never spawn more than 22 bots at once.**

If you know what you are doing, the bot limit can be adjusted further by editing the memory patches found in `100mvm.txt`.

Keep in mind that increasing the bot count beyond the defender count will make bots start occupying human slots and reduce the visible slot count until the bots are manually kicked from the server.
